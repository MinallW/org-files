#+TITLE: C Programming

In order for a better understanding of programming in general, I'll scan some C
code, partly from OpenBSD repositories due to its code correctness and security
in mind.

* cat

The code for this command in OpenBSD can be found at: [[lat: https://github.com/openbsd/src/blob/master/bin/cat/cat.c][This link]]

Starting from what it includes, we have:

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
#include <sys/types.h>
#+END_SRC

Includes in it data types, in this file only the *blksize_t* type is used, used
for block sizes.
