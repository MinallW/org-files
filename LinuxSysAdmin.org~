'A UNIX operating system consists of a /kernel/ and some /system
programs/. There are also some /application programs/ for doing
work. The kernel is the heart of the operating system. It keeps track
of files on the disk, starts programs and runs them concurrently,
assigns memory and other resources to various processes, receives
packets from and sends packets to the network, and so on.

The kernel does very little by itself, but it provides tools with
which all services can be built. It also prevents anyone from
accessing the hardware directly, forcing everyone to use the tools it
provides. This way the kernel provides some protection for users from
each other. The tools provided by the kernel are used via /system/
/calls/.
